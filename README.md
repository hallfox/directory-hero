##Directory Hero
This is a game about recursion. 

Directory Hero takes you on a journey through seven riddle-filled mazes. But these are not your ordinary mazes: every new path you find may show you three more. Yes, you are lost in your filesystem.

Directory Hero uses the Kivy framework for Python to display a directory tree to guide you through your journey. Because of this, it is very simple to design your own maze. Just create a folder in the "maps" directory to name your maze and begin building with folders, .txt files for information, or create your own .extension file to hide secret information.
