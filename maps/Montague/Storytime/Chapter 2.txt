One day, Bob found someone. It was a strange 
occurance to Bob. He wanted to jump over to 
meet him. Bob thought he wouldn't have to be 
alone anymore.

As Bob approached the new someone, a grim 
thought arose. Bob had never spoken in his 
life before, let alone to someone else. What 
would he say? How would he say it? Bob froze 
in fright at these troublesome thoughts. He 
thought he may not approach the someone at all.

But it was too late. The someone had noticed 
Bob and look toward his way. Bob was a nervous 
bunny. Bob had never been nervous before in his 
life. He thought he might fall over from the 
terrible knot in his stomach. Yet in that moment, 
Bob jumped up and said:

"My name is Bob, and I'm a 2 year-old bunny!"
