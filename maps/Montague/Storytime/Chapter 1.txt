This is the story of a bunny named Bob.

All Bob ever knew were two things: his name and his age.
Bob wasn't even sure he was a "he." All he knew was that 
he had a name and he was only 2 years old.

Bob was not like any other bunny. Bunnies lived in the 
woods and ate grass. But Bob did not live in the woods. 
He had never eaten anything like grass before in his life, 
as far as he knew.

Bob didn't know how to be a bunny. He had never met one 
before, besides himself that is. He had never met anyone 
before. Bob was alone.
