Bob surprised himself. He had no idea what had 
overcome him, but he had managed to introduce 
himself to the someone in the most succinct way 
possible. And it was only his first time.

The someone looked at Bob with a turned head. 
The someone was a peculiar looking creature who 
had a distinctly different appearance than Bob, 
but they were both about the same size. The 
someone wasn't fuzzy like Bob was. Instead the 
someone looked shiny and had only two feet 
instead of four like Bob.
