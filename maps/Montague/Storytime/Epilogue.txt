Epilogue ~ The Quackening

Unbeknownst to Bob and his friend the duck, they 
were being watched from afar. By a chair, 
nonetheless. And this chair was particularly 
interested in the affairs of Bob and the duck.

The chair cannot think. It is unconsciouss, 
inanimate, and altogether made of wood. But it 
could feel. In fact, it felt quite jealous of Bob 
and the duck, for even though their story was 
tragic, the chair could not even dream of being a 
minor character in their story, let alone a main 
character. This was because it could not sleep, and 
therefore could not dream. It is a chair, after all.

This made the chair very sad and angry and jealous. 
And as everyone knows, chairs are not supposed to feel 
anything. But the chair felt so hot with rage, so 
striken with depression, so poisoned by envy, that all 
its paradoxical emotion burst forth into the air.

And thus, the chair quacked.
