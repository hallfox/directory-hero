Bob waited for a response. Bob waited so long for 
a response he thought perhaps the someone couldn't 
speak. Bob began to feel a little sad, but when Bob 
tried to talk to him again, he realized the only thing 
he could say was: "My name is Bob, and I'm a 2 
year-old bunny!"

It was at this point Bob felt like crying. But the 
someone sensed this and quickly reacted the only way 
it knen how. The someone let out a noise. It is was 
the raspiest, flattest, and honkiest noise Bob had 
ever heard. Bob began to cry.

But Bob shouldn't be surprised. After all, if it 
looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then 
it probably is a duck.
